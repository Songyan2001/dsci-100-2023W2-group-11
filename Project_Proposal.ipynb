    "\n",
    "Tennis is the world's most popular individual sport worldwide. At the elite level, the sport is played on various types of surfaces including hard (US Open), clay (Paris), and grass (Wimbledon). The surface used can greatly affect the game since the bounces go at different speeds. For example, clay slows the ball down thus giving precise players an advantage whereas grass prefers quicker players. Therefore, our research question is that: Based on the number of aces in a game, will the surface of a court be hard, or clay? \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the question, we will use the data set provided by “Tennis Data”.  There is a mix of qualitative and quantitative variables about various tennis games. Each observation is a specific tennis game whereas the variables provide insight into the score, number of aces, surface, tournament and more. "
